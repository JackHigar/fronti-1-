Hey everyone , This is Rudransh Awasthi aka Jack higar . I made fronti (inetial idea was image to code as at that time the ai models(chatbots) were not so powerful to convert the ui or wireframe img to perfect code ) 
so i started this project , I named it fronti( frontend+ai) I got this idea near descember 2024 and soon after collecting some money,  I bought My 1st ever domain fronti.tech on desember 2024 . This was the 1st ever 
code I wrote for fronti (honestely not full code is written by me few block i used chatgtp to write but mostely is by me ) The date was 13 jan 2025 I pushed these codes to github ( this is not the orignal profile i posted ) .
I made more variations better ui , better backend And do what a 13 year old can do . I applied to yc on may 13 2025 , we did it on last day of submission and yeh we didnt get selected . But thats not what matters 
as a 13 year old I have did some crazy shit . Any way you can use code without even thinking twice , but you may need to do some tweeks as openai version and little things might be old as its being one year . 
And the fun fact today 1 year ago fronti was born on 31 december 2024 and today is day it is closing 31 december 2025 because I dont have money to keep running it and domain provider is asking too much and to be honest
it was over a long time ago . I have made some crazy shit like fronti , quantum sequrity project and many more small tools and few incomplete project . THATS IT WHAT IT MATTER AT END OF DAY . 
THANKYOU UTKARSH TO BELIEVING IN AND TO BE A GREAT PARTNER IN THIS JOURNEY . 
THANKYOU TO MY PARENTS TO BELIEVE IN ME
THANKYOU TO UNIVERSE(Spinoza GOD)TO MAKE ME EVEN IF WE ARE YOUR MISTAKE.
